Project Title: Library Management System

Description:
Create a simple library management system where users can borrow and return books. The system should have the following functionalities:

Classes:

Book: Represents a book with properties such as title, author, genre, ISBN, etc.
User: Represents a library user with properties like name, ID, etc.
Library: Represents the library itself, containing a collection of books and users.
Inner Class:

Library class can have an inner class BookShelf to manage the collection of books.
Interface:

Borrowable: An interface that defines methods for borrowing and returning books.
Access Control:

Use access modifiers to control access to certain methods and properties within classes.
Primitive Types:

Use primitive types like int, String, boolean, etc., for storing data such as book IDs, user IDs, etc.
Enumeration:

Create an enumeration for book genres (e.g., Fiction, Non-fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi, etc.).
Cast:

Demonstrate casting when retrieving elements from arrays or collections.
Control Flow:

Implement control flow mechanisms like switch, for-loop, do-while for menu-driven interactions with the library system.
Array:

Use arrays to manage collections of books, users, etc.
Functionality:

Users can view the list of available books in the library.
Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
Users can borrow books (if available) and return them.
Librarians (admin users) can add new books to the library, remove books, and register new users.
Error handling for cases like trying to borrow an already borrowed book, returning a book that wasn't borrowed, etc.
Additional Features (Optional):

Implement a GUI using JavaFX for a more user-friendly interface.
Store data in a database for persistence.
Allow users to reserve books if they are currently borrowed by someone else.
Implement a rating system for books and users.
Generate reports such as most borrowed books, overdue books, etc.
This project will provide a comprehensive understanding and implementation of various Java concepts like classes, interfaces, access control, primitive types, enumeration, casting, control flow, and arrays in a real-world application scenario.
